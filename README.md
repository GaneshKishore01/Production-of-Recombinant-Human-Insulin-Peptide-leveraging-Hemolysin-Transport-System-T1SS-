## Overview
A synthetic biology design for producing **insulin in E. coli** using the **Type I Secretion System (T1SS)**  
and **self-cleaving inteins**, integrated into a **hollow-fiber bioreactor**.

## Goal and Procedure
To develop a system for localized insulin production within cells—to be potentially housed in a hollow fiber bioreactor—we are engineering a fusion protein with the structure: insulin – N-terminal cleaving intein – HlyA. The N terminal cleaving mini intein is derived from Ssb DnaB (Mathys et al., 1998). This fusion protein will be secreted by type I secretion system which has been previously used for export of Shiga-like toxin IIeB subunit Salmonella Typhimurium aroA, where there were no quantifiable protein present in the cytoplasm and the secreted protein showed binding to its respectable receptor. (tzschaschel et al., 1996)
The fusion protein would be cloned into plasmid Pbad33-Gm with expression induced by L-arabinose Induced.
The associated secretion machinery—HlyB and HlyD—will be expressed under the control of the pVDL9.3 vector, which are under induction of lactose/IPTG by lac promoter.
TolC, the third component of the T1SS complex, is natively expressed in the Shuffle E. coli strain used for this system.
Cleavage of the insulin fusion protein will be triggered by change of pH (6.5-7), activating the N-terminal cleaving intein, thereby releasing free insulin from the fusion construct.


## Features
 ![Image Alt](https://github.com/GaneshKishore01/Production-of-Recombinant-Human-Insulin-Peptide-leveraging-Hemolysin-Transport-System-T1SS-/blob/main/image4.png)
- Plasmid-based secretion design (pET28a & PBAD33)  
- Fusion constructs: Insulin–Intein–HlyA  
- ELISA-based validation plan  
- Theoretical stability and docking analysis  

## Goal
A **modular, decentralized biomanufacturing platform** capable of producing insulin at near-industrial purity  
in localized, low-cost facilities.

# REMARKS- We acheived 60-70% of our expected fluorescence, translating to 3/4th of out Target reached
