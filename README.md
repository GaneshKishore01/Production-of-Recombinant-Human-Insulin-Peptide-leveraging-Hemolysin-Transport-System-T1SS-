# insulin-bioreactor-framework
A synthetic biology design for producing **insulin in E. coli** using the **Type I Secretion System (T1SS)**   and **self-cleaving inteins**, integrated into a **hollow-fiber bioreactor**.
based on guidance and experiments done in University of Jagiollian, CIMS Bilaspur and SAGEMM college Durg, with the diretion of Prof. Marek Sanka (UJ) and  of Ms Hema Kulkarni(SAGEMM college)

## Overview
A synthetic biology design for producing **insulin in E. coli** using the **Type I Secretion System (T1SS)**  
and **self-cleaving inteins**, integrated into a **hollow-fiber bioreactor**.

## Features
- Plasmid-based secretion design (pET28a & PBAD33)  
- Fusion constructs: Insulin–Intein–HlyA  
- ELISA-based validation plan  
- Theoretical stability and docking analysis  

## Goal
A **modular, decentralized biomanufacturing platform** capable of producing insulin at near-industrial purity  
in localized, low-cost facilities.


REMARKS- DOCKING AND EVERYTHING WORKS WELL, SHOULD WORK
